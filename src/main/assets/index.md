[Simpletask](https://github.com/mpcjanssen/simpletask-android) is based on the brilliant [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) by [Gina Trapani](http://ginatrapani.org/). The goal of the application is to provide a tool to do GTD without providing an overwhelming amount of options. Even though Simpletask can be customised by a fairly large amount of settings, the defaults should be sane and require no change.

[Simpletask](http://mpcjanssen.nl/doc/simpletask/) can be used as a very simple todo list manager or as a more complex action manager for GTD or [Manage Your Now](./MYN.md).

Extensions
----------

Simpletask supports the following todo.txt extensions:

-   Due date as due:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Start/threshold date as t:YYYY-MM-DD
-   Recurrence with rec:[0-9]+[dwmy] as described [here](https://github.com/bram85/todo.txt-tools/wiki/Recurrence) but with a twist.
    -   By default Simpletask will use the dates in that task to create the recurring task not the date of completion as descibed in the link. This behaviour can be configured from the settings.
